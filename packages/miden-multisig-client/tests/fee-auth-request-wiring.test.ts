/**
 * Carries the fee wiring through a real `TransactionRequest` and reads it back
 * out of the built object, which is as close to the VM as this package gets
 * without a node. The builder tests in `src/transaction/feeWiring.test.ts`
 * record the calls against a fake builder, so they prove the arguments the
 * builders pass and nothing about whether the SDK stores them: an auth arg the
 * WASM silently dropped, or an advice entry keyed off something other than the
 * commitment, passes there and aborts in `pay_fee`.
 *
 * The remaining untested link is the VM itself. Nothing here executes MASM, so
 * an operand order that disagrees with `load_conversion_info` still round trips
 * — see the note on the Rust-computed digest in `src/transaction/feeAuth.test.ts`.
